For combining multiple commits to one we use 'Squash'
In collaborative projects, squash helps in choosing and combing particular
commits and processing them.

Steps - 
1. git log - check the commits you want to combine 
2. Lets consider we want to squash commits C2 and C3 
3. We rebase on the third commit. 
	git rebase -i HEAD~4
4. we use s and specify C3 so that it considers C2 and C3 to combine. 

In case of all the commits to squash, we use HEAD~<no. of recent commits to combine>
and in case of commits that are selective and not in order, we use pick instead
of s.
