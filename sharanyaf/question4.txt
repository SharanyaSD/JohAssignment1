Reset is used to deleet commits made. 

Specifying reset --soft will undo some changes in git repo but also preserve some changes, decided by developers.
Whereas, using reset --hard will reset work permanently, back to previous point where everything worked fine.

To delete the most recent commit we use reset hard specifying 1  
git reset ---hard HEAD~1

To delete multiple commits we use reset hard specifying N 
git reset --hard HEAD~N

git revert can be used in cases when you want to delete a particular commit in 
between without making any alters on later commits

Deleted commits can be seen using git reflog.
