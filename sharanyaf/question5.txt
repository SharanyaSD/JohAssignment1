Git push --force command basically overwrites the remote branch with the local 
branch, that means it does not consider any conflicts of commit matches, 
rather forcefully overwrites. may lead to losses. 

Wherein, git pus --force-with-lease allows changes only if remote and local 
branches have same commit. Incase if the remote branch is updated by someone, 
the push will not work, basically be cancelled.
It is a safer alternative
