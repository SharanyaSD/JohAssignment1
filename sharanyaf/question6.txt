git reset will reset all the changes from staged area. 
git reset <file>
git restore <file>


Or rather, .gitignore file is basically a simple file created to any directory of a project. anything affed to this will not be staged or committed.
touch .gitignore
then we can add files to it that need to be unstaged.
